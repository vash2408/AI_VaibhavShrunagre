I-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Animation Automation System
Project Overview
The AI-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Animation Automation System is a comprehensive platform designed to automatically generate educational animated videos from natural language queries. By leveraging a knowledge graph, AI content generation, and the Manim animation engine, this system transforms complex educational topics into clear and engaging visual content. The system is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation.





Core Features

Knowledge Graph (Neo4j): Stores educational content in an interconnected format, allowing for semantic queries and relationship discovery across various domains like Data Structures, GIS, and Space Technology.




AI-Powered Script Generation (OpenAI GPT-4): Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4 to create structured, pedagogically sound educational scripts and slide content based on the knowledge graph data.



Manim Animation Engine: Automatically generates precise and high-quality educational visualizations by converting structured slide content into Python code for the Manim animation library.



Microservices Architecture: The system uses a microservices pattern with components like an API Gateway, Knowledge Graph Service, AI Content Service, and Manim Render Service, each independently deployable and scalable.





End-to-End Automation: The entire pipeline, from a student's natural language query to the final video delivery, is fully automated, ensuring efficient content creation.


System Architecture
The system is designed with a microservices architecture to ensure clear separation of concerns and scalable design principles. The main components communicate via an API Gateway and asynchronous message queues.





Component Breakdown

User Interface: A web-based front end for students to submit queries and view generated videos.


API Gateway: The single entry point for all requests, orchestrating communication between the different microservices.



Knowledge Graph Service: Manages the Neo4j database, handling queries and updates to the educational content.



Content Extract: Processes unstructured data like books to populate the knowledge graph with concepts and relationships.


AI Processing: Generates educational scripts using OpenAI GPT-4 based on content retrieved from the knowledge graph.



Manim Engine: Executes the generated Python code to render the final animated video files.


Storage System: Stores the final MP4 video files, scripts, and other metadata for efficient retrieval.

Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the system locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Docker & Docker Compose

Neo4j Desktop or Docker Image

OpenAI API Key

Steps
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Set up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
Run with Docker Compose:

Bash

docker-compose up --build
This command will build and run all the microservices, including the Neo4j database instance.

Usage
Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000 (or the configured port).

Enter a query related to an educational topic (e.g., "Explain Binary Search Trees with an animation" or "What is the Big O notation for Quick Sort?").

The system will process the query, generate the script, and render the animation.

Once completed, the animated video will be available for viewing on the interface.
